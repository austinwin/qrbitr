**QRBitr (cue-are-bitter)** is a privacy-first, offline tool for sending and receiving data using QR codes.  
It’s fast, mobile-friendly, and works entirely in your browser—no accounts, no cloud, no tracking.  
Just open the app, scan or generate QR codes, and transfer data securely between devices.  

I built QRBitr for my own needs, but I hope it helps others who want a simple, private way to move text or files between devices—without the internet.
